*
*	The CLEAR*.L86 libraries provide a large number of functions which
* are not needed by every program, but which must be linked into the program
* because their usage is data driven.  One example is the floating point 
* conversion routines in the "printf()" function.  The programmer can specify
* "%f", "%g" or "%e" conversions which the linker can not detect.  If the
* program never needs or uses these conversions, the code in the "printf()"
* routine will never be used.  The "option.h" module gives the programmer
* a mechanism of communicating to the linker that certain low level functions
* are optional (not used by the program), and can be left out to save space
* in the program load image (.CMD file).
*
*	"option.h" provides a set of definitions which allow the programmer
* to specify certain options of the CLEAR* Run Time libraries (CLEARS.L86 or
* CLEARL.L86) which the program does not use.  The programmer can 
* choose broad sets of options (i.e. "MINIMAL"), or can choose specific 
* options to stub out of the final program (i.e. "NOFLOAT").
*
*	Each definition contains a "tag declaration".  The tag declaration
* will link in a module from the OPTION*.L86 (OPTIONS.L86 or OPTIONL.L86)
* library which also contains a "stubroutine" for some internal 
* function of the CLEAR* Run Time Library.
*
*	For example, the definition of NOFLOAT is "int nofloat();".  When
* the programmer specifies "NOFLOAT" in the source file and then links the
* final program with the OPTION* library, the linker links in the module from
* the OPTION* library which contains "nofloat()".  This module also contains
* certain stubroutines which satisfy functional references to the floating
* point conversion routines in "printf()".  Thus, the code for these
* conversions will not be linked into the final program load image.  If
* the program happens to use the "%f", "%g" or "%e" printf() conversions, 
* the stubroutines provided will print an error message and exit.
*
*	We recommend that the programmer compile a separate module containing
* the tag definitions, and then link this module and the OPTION* library
* along with the rest of the program.  For example, to reduce the size of
* the "hello.c" program load image, the programmer could prepare a file 
* (named "opt.c" in this example) that looks like:
*    opt.c:
*	#include "option.h"
*	MINIMAL
* Then, after compiling hello.c and opt.c, the link command should look like:
*     LINK86 HELLO,OPT,OPTIONS.L86[SEARCH
* Note that the "[SEARCH]" option is very important, since LINK86 will pull
* in all routines in OPTIONS.L86 if you do not use this option.
*
*
*	Specific options are documented below.
